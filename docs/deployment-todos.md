# Archtree Deployment TODOs

This file tracks infrastructure work that is intentionally deferred and cannot
be completed solely through application code.

## Production HTTPS for Authentication

Status: Single-instance TLS is deployed and password login is verified on a
physical device. Refresh, profile, and session-revocation lifecycle checks
remain pending.

Current state:

- Route 53 resolves the production domain to the healthy single-instance
  Elastic Beanstalk environment.
- Nginx serves a trusted, renewable Let's Encrypt certificate and redirects
  public HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- Physical-device Debug and Release iOS builds use
  `https://api.example.com`;
  simulator Debug builds retain the localhost override.
- Archtree trusts the single deployed Nginx proxy hop, and public HTTP cannot
  bypass the HTTPS redirect with a forged forwarded-protocol header.

Remaining rollout and capability gates:

- [ ] Enroll the project in a paid Apple Developer team. The active iOS target
      intentionally omits Sign in with Apple and Associated Domains
      entitlements until this is available.
- [x] Choose a production API domain owned by the project.
- [x] Add repository configuration for public certificate issuance and renewal
      directly on the single Elastic Beanstalk instance.
- [x] Add instance security-group ingress for port 443.
- [x] Point production DNS to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
- [x] Set `HTTPS_DOMAIN`, `ACME_EMAIL`, and `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS=1` in Elastic
      Beanstalk, then deploy after DNS resolves to the instance.
- [x] Confirm Let's Encrypt issuance and the HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect.
- [x] Verify `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` against the deployed proxy chain.
- [x] Change the iOS Release `ARCHTREE_AUTH_BASE_URL` to the production
      `https://` domain.
- [x] Verify password login over HTTPS from a signed physical-device build.
- [ ] Verify refresh rotation, `/auth/me`, logout, and logout-all over HTTPS
      from a signed physical-device build.
- [ ] Verify the SES sender/domain, grant the runtime only `ses:SendEmail`, and
      configure `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` plus an `AUTH_CODE_PEPPER`.
- [ ] Configure the iOS Associated Domains entitlement after the production
      authentication domain exists.
- [ ] Enable Sign in with Apple for `com.example.finitude`, refresh its
      provisioning profile, and set `APPLE_CLIENT_IDS` to every accepted app or
      service client identifier.
- [ ] Create Google iOS and server OAuth clients. Set the iOS
      `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID`, and
      `GOOGLE_SERVER_CLIENT_ID` build settings, and set Archtree
      `GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS` to the accepted server client identifiers.
- [ ] Verify first-time Apple registration, Apple private relay, repeat login,
      Google registration, repeat login, provider revocation, and nonce
      rejection on a signed device build.
- [ ] Verify an existing email cannot be silently linked while signed out and
      can be linked only from an authenticated account-management flow.
- [ ] Set `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`, `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN`, and `WEBAUTHN_RP_NAME` for the
      final HTTPS authentication domain.
- [ ] Add `webcredentials:<WEBAUTHN_RP_ID>` to the signed iOS Associated Domains
      entitlement and publish a valid `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
      file containing the app identifier.
- [ ] Verify passkey enrollment, discoverable sign-in, cancellation, replay
      rejection, counter updates, synced-device use, and lost-passkey recovery
      on signed physical devices.
- [ ] If legacy-token compatibility is temporarily enabled for rollout, remove
      `ALLOW_LEGACY_AUTH_TOKENS=true` after the migration window.

Safety constraints while rollout work remains:

- Do not weaken the iOS secure-authentication URL check or ATS policy.
- Do not remove Archtree's production secure-transport middleware.
- Do not regress production authentication to a remote HTTP endpoint.

Completion evidence:

- HTTPS responds successfully with a trusted certificate.
- HTTP authentication is rejected or redirected without processing credentials.
- A signed physical-device build completes password login over HTTPS.
- Refresh, profile, and session-revocation operations complete over HTTPS
  before the full authentication lifecycle is considered verified.
